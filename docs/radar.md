## how to setup

### port setup

make sure port `6460` is open.
this includes your computers firewall settings, as well as your routers port forwarding.
if you do not know how to do this, please do not ask me, but consult the internet for help.

### starting

execute `npm install` inside radar folder, to install all needed dependencies.
execute run script: `./run.sh`.
this will build the svelte web frontend, and start the websocket/html server.
